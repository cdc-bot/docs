# cdc-bot Documentation
## What's cdc-bot?
Well, that's quite a difficult question to answer really..<br> It started as just me wanting to make a Discord utility bot, but slowly I realized that wasn't the most fun idea :/<br>
Once I've realized that, I've started a new codebase known as today's **cdc-bot**, it only consists of fun commands as of right now.
## What are these docs for?
Honestly, it was just me getting bored and looking for something to make, they're not really that useful.
## Why?
Because.
Anyway, look around these docs as much as you'd like!<br><br>
